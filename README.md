## Requirements
* The Sims 4 installed on your PC (Steam, EA App, or Origin)
* A free [ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/) account (optional but recommended)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or any archive extraction software
* Basic understanding of navigating Windows folders

## Game Version Notes
The Sims 4 is generally the same across all PC launchers:

| Version | Moddable | Notes |
|--------|---------- | ----- |
| **EA App / Origin** | Yes | Official PC release, fully moddable |
| **Steam** | Yes | Generally same instructions as EA version |
| **Console (PS/Xbox)** | Mods are **not supported** |

**NOTE** - Some mods break after game updates or patches. Make sure the mod supports the latest game version!

## Backup Your Game Files!
Before installing mods, it's smart to back up your saves and mods folder.

1. Navigate to your Sims 4 folder.
    ```
    Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4
    ```

2. Copy and paste the following folders to a backup location.
    * `Mods`
    * `Saves`
    * `Tray` (for saved lots and Sims)

This ensures you can revert changes if a mod crashes your game or potentially corrupts your installation.

## Where To Download Sims 4 Mods
Here are a few websites you can download mods from.

- [ModTheSims](https://modthesims.info/)
- [The Sims Resource](https://www.thesimsresource.com/)
- [Lumpinou Mods (generally for story mods)](https://www.lumpinou.com/)
- [Sims 4 Studio Forums](https://sims4studio.com/)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/sims4/mods)

**TIP** - Always download from trusted creators and **avoid sketchy ad sites or paywalled mods**.

## Installing Mods Manually
1. Download the `.zip` or `.rar` file for the mod.
2. Use 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract the files.
3. Place the `.package`, `.ts4script`, or folders into the following folder.
    ```
    Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods
    ```
**WARNING** - Do not go deeper than one folder inside `Mods`. Files buried too deep may not load.  
**TIP** - Organize your mods by category (e.g. `CAS`, `Furniture`, `Gameplay`) for easier management.

### Script Mods and Package Mods
There are two main types of mods for The Sims 4.

### `.package` Files
- Most common format (clothing, hair, furniture, etc.)
- Can be placed directly into the `Mods` folder or one subfolder deep.

### `.ts4script` Files
- Used for advanced script mods (e.g. UI mods, gameplay systems, etc.)
- **Must** be directly inside the `Mods` folder or one subfolder deep.
- Only enable these if you trust the mod author!

**NOTE** - After game updates, **script mods** are often disabled automatically.

## Installing Mods With CurseForge's Mod Manager
CurseForge now supports The Sims 4 in their mod manager, making it easier to install and update mods:

1. Download and install the [CurseForge App](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app).
2. Select **The Sims 4** from the supported games list.
3. Browse and install mods directly from the manager.
4. The manager handles installation and folder placement automatically.

This is great for casual modders or those overwhelmed by manual installations!

## How To Enable Mods In-Game
Mods won't work until you **enable them in-game**. To do so, perform the following steps.

1. Launch The Sims 4.
2. Navigate to `Options` > `Game Options` > `Other`.
3. Enable the following settings.
    - ✅ "Enable Custom Content and Mods"
    - ✅ "Script Mods Allowed"
4. Click the `Apply Changes` button and restart the game.

After restarting, your mods and CC (custom content) should be active.

### Notes
### Managing Mods and CC
To stay organized and avoid crashes.

- Delete outdated or broken mods after game patches.
- Read each mod description to check for updates or compatibility notes.
- Use [Sims 4 Mod Manager](https://www.modmanager.site/) for light-weight mod sorting (optional).
- If you're using a large mod pack, I recommend testing it on a fresh save first.
